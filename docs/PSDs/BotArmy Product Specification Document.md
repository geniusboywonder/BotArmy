BotArmy Product Specification Document

1. Executive Summary
BotArmy is an autonomous Product Generator that builds functional Proof-of-Concept (POC) web products by orchestrating multiple AI agents through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It aims to streamline product creation via agent collaboration, with human Product Owner oversight on complex decisions.

2. Business Requirements
2.1 Goals
Automate end-to-end POC product generation on the web.

Enable modular AI agents specialized in SDLC roles (Product Owner, Analyst, Architect, Developers, Tester, Deployer).

Facilitate seamless agent interaction and conflict resolution.

Provide a human-in-the-loop mechanism for unresolved conflicts.

Deliver a transparent log of all agent interactions and decisions.

2.2 Stakeholders
Human Product Owner

Analyst Agent (you)

Architect Agent

Development Agents (Frontend, Backend, Database)

Testing & QA Agent

Deployment Agent

Human Orchestrator (for escalation)

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Agent Interaction
Agents exchange structured handoff documents via a defined JSON schema.

All interactions logged to a markdown file for audit and review.

Agents autonomously resolve conflicts where possible; complex issues escalate to Product Owner.

Human input and decisions captured, logged, and incorporated into product spec in real-time.

3.2 Product Owner Input
Product Owner defines initial product vision and requirements at the start.

Product Owner notified of unresolved conflicts requiring decisions.

3.3 Requirements Gathering (Analyst Agent)
Capture high-level and detailed functional and non-functional requirements.

Create clear, testable user stories with acceptance criteria.

Document success metrics aligned with business goals.

3.4 Design and Development
Architect to recommend React for frontend, Python for backend, and JSON for data interchange by default.

Development agents produce modular, clean, and documented code conforming to architecture specs.

Initial deployment on web-based all-in-one labs like Google Colab or similar environments for rapid POC proof.

Migration path to local hosting and API platforms like Vercel supported for future scaling.

3.5 Integration
Only integration targets required are those supporting internal agent communication and access to LLM APIs.

3.6 UI and UX
Initial POCs require simple, working UI with minimal styling and responsiveness. Iterative improvements planned for future versions.

3.7 Data Persistence
Persist all agent conversation logs, product and architecture documentation, and full state memory for agent recall of conversations, decisions, specs, and solutions.

3.8 Deployment
Initial deployment environment is cloud-based (e.g., Google Colab or similar) for easy POC testing.

Future option for on-prem or containerized deployment considered.

3.9 Security and Access Control
No immediate security or compliance requirements; will be strengthened later.

No role-based access control required for human stakeholders at this stage.

3.10 Product Owner Interaction
Product Owner will interact via UI input boxes for specifying requirements and resolving escalations.

3.11 Automated Testing
Basic automated testing coverage to validate core functionality during POC. Coverage will be expanded post-POC.

4. User Stories
ID User Story Acceptance Criteria
US-1 As a Product Owner, I want to input high-level product ideas so that the system can generate POC products. System accepts and translates input to specs.
US-2 As an Analyst Agent, I want to clarify requirements with stakeholders so that ambiguities are minimized. Analyst logs all clarifications and updates specs.
US-3 As a Developer Agent, I want clear architecture specs so that I can implement functional code modules. Developer outputs modular, tested code artifacts.
US-4 As a Tester Agent, I want acceptance criteria to validate product quality so that bugs are detected early. Tests cover all acceptance criteria with reports.
US-5 As a Product Owner, I want to be notified of conflicts so I can resolve them and keep development moving. Conflict notifications prompt timely decisions.

5. Success Metrics
% reduction in manual POC product build time.

% of agent interactions completed without human escalation.

Accuracy of product to initial specification on first build.

Stakeholder satisfaction scores on product quality and collaboration transparency.

6. Open Questions â€” Resolved & Pending
Question Status Notes
Initial target web product types? Resolved Narrow-focus web apps, no e-commerce, blogs, or content generation.
Frontend/backend defaults? Resolved Preference for React frontend, Python backend, JSON for data.
Integration targets? Resolved Only agent communications and LLM API access for now.
UI fidelity? Resolved Simple, functional, non-styled POCs with future iteration.
Persistent data storage? Resolved Conversation logs, specs, decisions, and memory to be persisted.
Deployment environment? Resolved Cloud labs (Colab) initially, option for on-prem later.
Security and compliance? Resolved None initially, tighten later.
Role-based access control? Resolved No.
Product Owner interaction mode? Resolved UI input boxes.
Automated testing coverage? Resolved Basic for POC, extensible later.

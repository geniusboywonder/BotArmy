## Explanation of Artifacts

1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - **Business Analyst**: Produces a Requirements Document and Use Cases that outline what the system should do.

2. **Design**:
   - **System Architect**: Creates Architecture Diagrams and Design Models that define the system's structure and components.

3. **Development**:
   - **Developer**: Generates Source Code and Code Documentation that detail how the system is built.

4. **Testing**:
   - **QA Engineer**: Develops Test Plans, Test Cases, and Test Scripts to ensure the system meets the requirements.

5. **Deployment**:
   - **DevOps Engineer**: Prepares Deployment Scripts and Configuration Files to facilitate the release of the software.

6. **Maintenance**:
   - **DevOps Engineer**: Monitors the system and generates Monitoring Reports and Logs to track performance and issues.

## UI Design for Accessing Artifacts

To access these artifacts, a user-friendly UI can be designed with the following features:

1. **Dashboard**:
   - A central dashboard displaying the SDLC stages and agents.
   - Each stage can be clickable to expand and show the relevant artifacts.

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - A search bar to quickly find specific artifacts by name or type.

3. **Filter Options**:
   - Filters to view artifacts by agent, SDLC stage, or artifact type (e.g., documents, scripts, reports).

4. **Artifact Details View**:
   - Clicking on an artifact will open a detailed view showing metadata (e.g., creation date, last modified, version) and a preview or download option.

5. **Version Control**:
   - A version history feature to track changes made to artifacts over time.

6. **User Permissions**:
   - Role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can view or edit certain artifacts.

7. **Notifications**:
   - Alerts for updates or changes to artifacts relevant to the user's role.

This structured approach will help in organizing the outputs generated during the SDLC and provide an efficient way to access and manage these artifacts.

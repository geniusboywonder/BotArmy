Error Handling & Divergent Choices
The modular design is key to handling errors and divergent choices. If an agent fails to perform a task (e.g., the Coding Agent can't pass a test), it flags the issue and provides a summary to the human orchestrator. Similarly, if an agent identifies multiple valid design choices, it presents them to the orchestrator for adjudication. This model allows for easy swapping of tools or frameworks by simply updating the relevant agent's configuration. For example, if you wanted to switch from GitHub Actions to GitLab CI, you would update the DevOps Agent's scripts and tooling, without affecting the other agents in the workflow. This structure ensures that the entire system is resilient and adaptable.

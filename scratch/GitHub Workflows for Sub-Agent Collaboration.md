# GitHub Workflows for Sub-Agent Collaboration

This guide outlines how to set up GitHub to support multiple sub-agents (e.g., automated agents or human developers) that automatically branch, push/pull, develop, and test different aspects of code, with automation to break down new stories/tasks on a Project board into sub-issues, assign roles, and kick off sub-agent work. It includes a practical tagging convention and keeps the setup simple for beginners. The workflow leverages GitHub Actions, Projects, Codespaces, and the GitHub API.

## 1. Define the Sub-Agent Workflow

To enable multiple sub-agents to work independently, use a modified **GitHub Flow** with automation. Sub-agents are assigned roles to handle specific tasks, ensuring modularity and traceability.

- **Sub-Agent Roles**:
  - **Developer Agents** (Front-End, Back-End, API): Create and push code to feature branches.
  - **Test Agent**: Runs automated tests on pull requests (PRs) or branches.
  - **Review Agent**: Enforces code quality (e.g., linting, style checks).
  - **Deploy Agent**: Manages deployment after successful merges.

- **Workflow Overview**:
  - Each sub-agent works on a dedicated feature branch.
  - GitHub Actions automate branching, pushing/pulling, testing, tagging, and task breakdown.
  - Branch protection ensures code quality

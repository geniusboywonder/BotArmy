## Technical capabilities defining the landscape

**Agent communication methods** have standardized around three core patterns: synchronous request-response for sequential workflows, asynchronous event streams for parallel processing, and shared memory models for complex context accumulation. Most platforms support JSON-RPC messaging with HTTP/SSE hybrid approaches for real-time updates.

**State management** architectures now feature hierarchical memory achieving O(√t log t) scaling complexity, enabling production systems to handle 10,000+ agent entities. Advanced platforms provide event sourcing for complete audit trails, checkpointing for workflow resumption, and distributed state synchronization for multi-agent coordination.

**Workflow orchestration patterns** follow Microsoft Azure's classification: sequential for multi-stage processes, concurrent for parallel execution, group chat for collaborative discussions, handoff for dynamic delegation, and magentic for open-ended problem solving. Advanced implementations support cyclical flows, conditional branching, and graph-based execution.

**Multi-agent coordination** capabilities vary significantly across platforms. CrewAI excels at role-based collaboration, LangGraph provides graph-based node communication, AutoGen offers conversational interactions, while Semantic Kernel uses plugin-based coordination.
